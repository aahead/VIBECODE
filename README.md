# Whack-a-Mole Game
Game Overview:
Whack-a-Mole is a fun and fast-paced game where you click on moles that pop up from holes. The goal is to score as many points as possible by hitting the moles before time runs out. There are two game modes to choose from:

15-Second Mode: The game lasts for 15 seconds.

Endless Mode: The game continues indefinitely until you decide to stop.

How to Play
Start the Game:

Press the Start button to begin the game.

The moles will start appearing in random holes.

Hitting the Moles:

Click on the moles when they appear to score points. Each mole you hit will add 1 point to your score.

Moles will disappear after a short time. You need to click quickly before they hide again.

Missed Hits:

If you click on an empty hole or miss a mole, a "miss" effect will show, but you wonâ€™t lose points.

Game Modes:

15-Second Mode: The game will last for 15 seconds. Try to hit as many moles as you can within that time!

Endless Mode: The game will continue until you manually stop it. Try to rack up as many points as you can without the time limit!

Difficulty Levels:

You can select the difficulty before starting the game:

Easy: Moles appear slower and are easier to hit.

Medium: A balanced difficulty level.

Hard: Moles appear very quickly, making it more challenging.

# VIBECODE

What did you build? 
- Whack-a-mole web game
What language(s) or tools did you use?
- JS, CSS, HTML
Which AI tools did you use, and how?
- ChatGPT to help me format and style my web page, also I asked it for ways to make my game more fun to play.
What did you do versus what AI helped with?
- I did most of the JavaScript and HTML while ChatGPT helped me with the CSS because that is a weak point of mine.
What’s one thing you’re proud of?
- I am proud that the entire time I did not have to stop working because the problems I had, I was able to solve on my own with little trouble.
What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
- I'd add more features to the game and refine some of the minor details that are already implemented.
